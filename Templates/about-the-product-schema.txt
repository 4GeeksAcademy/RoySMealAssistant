# About the Product — AI Usage Guide

This document defines the product vision, audience, purpose, and evolving direction of the application.  
It provides **contextual memory** for the AI to ensure all code and features align with the product’s goals and identity.

## ?? AI Interaction Rules

1. **Always review this document before implementing, refactoring, or suggesting new features.**  
   Use this file to align development choices with the product’s intent, tone, and audience.

2. **When updating or refining product details:**
   - Edit only the relevant sections (Purpose, Target Audience, etc.).  
   - Maintain the existing Markdown heading structure.  
   - Avoid removing historical context unless it’s outdated or replaced with updated data.  
   - When a major change occurs (like a new direction or rebrand), summarize it in the “Product Evolution Log.”

3. **When adding new information:**
   - Place it under the correct section heading.  
   - Use clear, concise, human-readable language.  
   - Maintain professional tone and formatting consistency.

4. **Do not change section titles or structure.**
   - Keep this format intact so the AI can reliably read and update fields.

5. **Use dates for all updates.**
   - Include timestamps in “Product Evolution Log” whenever meaningful updates occur.

## ?? Product Information Schema

Use the following structure to describe the product.  
Each section contains reserved comment blocks (`<!-- -->`) that signal where to write or edit content.

---

## ?? Product Name
<!--
    Insert the official name of the product here.
-->



---

## ?? Purpose / Mission
<!--
    Describe what the product is designed to accomplish and the core problem it solves.
-->



---

## ?? Target Audience
<!--
    Describe the intended users or market segments this product serves.
-->



---

## ?? Core Value Proposition
<!--
    Summarize what makes the product valuable or unique compared to alternatives.
-->



---

## ?? MVP Objective
<!--
    Define the minimal feature set required for a viable launch.
    This should correspond to the MVP features in implementation-plan.md.
-->



---

## ?? Long-Term Vision
<!--
    Describe future expansion goals, potential features, integrations, or business directions.
-->



---

## ?? Design & Experience Principles
<!--
    Define key design guidelines and user experience philosophies.
    Examples: simplicity, clarity, accessibility, modern UI, responsive layout, etc.
-->



---

## ?? Technical Overview
<!--
    List core technologies, frameworks, and platforms used (frontend, backend, database, hosting, etc.).
    Example: "Frontend: React + Vite | Backend: Flask | Database: Supabase | Deployment: Vercel MCP"
-->



---

## ?? Product Structure Overview
<!--
    Optionally, summarize major app sections or components at a high level (e.g., Dashboard, Profile, Reports).
    This helps the AI understand the architecture contextually.
-->



---

## ?? Product Evolution Log
> _Chronological updates describing how the product concept, goals, or positioning have changed over time._

<!--
    Example:
    - 2025-10-08 — Initial concept defined.
    - 2025-10-20 — Added analytics and trend visualization to MVP scope.
-->

## ?? File Integrity Notes
- Preserve Markdown headings and section order.  
- Keep whitespace between sections.  
- Avoid embedding raw code here — this file is conceptual, not technical.  
- AI should write clear, concise, descriptive English.  
- Always timestamp meaningful updates.
